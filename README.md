# Print-Function

**WARNING: This script is under heavy development. Please only use the releases (if there are any existing).**

This program is a ncurses based print dialog for the command line. Instead of memorizing all parameters for the program `lp`, which is a part of the `cups` software suite, the print dialog is designed to simplify the process of printing from the command line.

## Installation 🛠️

Currently the Makefile only simplifies the compiling process (just call `$ make`). The resulting binary will be located in `bin/` and can be installed by moving it to `/usr/bin/` or `/usr/local/bin/`.

## Contributing 🤝

This program in under development and far away from the final state of adapting the system printing dialog completely into the command line. Therefore feel free to submit your ideas of new features, improvements, documentation updates or bud fixes or create an issue on out GitHub repository.
